# DRAM Simulator (C#)

A C# based simulator for modeling and analyzing DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) behavior. This simulator allows users to explore different DRAM configurations, access patterns, and timing parameters to understand their impact on performance and power consumption.

## Features

- **DRAM Model:** Implements a detailed model of DRAM architecture, including banks, ranks, channels, and memory cells.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Allows users to customize key DRAM parameters like:
    - Timing parameters (tRCD, tRP, tRAS, etc.)
    - Bank organization
    - Channel and rank configuration
    - Memory capacity
- **Trace-Driven Simulation:** Supports trace-driven simulation, allowing users to input memory access patterns from files.
- **Performance Metrics:** Provides key performance metrics such as:
    - Throughput
    - Latency
    - Power consumption
- **Extensible Architecture:** Designed with an extensible architecture to allow for easy integration of new features and models.
- **C# Implementation:** Written in C# for performance and ease of use.
